# RoninNS
A CLI tool to update/install Northstar using Bash. :)
--
## What systems are compatible?
- RPM systems
- DEB systems: coming soon
## What does it do?
It installs the TF|2 modification, Northstar! It requires `curl`, a package made for downloading files. I have put it there to use it to get the NS files.
#### More coming soon!
Best regards,
Command-Git :D
