# Developer Compile Notes
## 1 - Prepare directories
- Create a directory named `RoninNS`.
- Inside the directory, create two subdirectories: `DEBIAN` and `bin`.
- Inside `DEBIAN`, make a file called `control`. Configure it with the package settings.
- Inside `bin`, make a final subdirectory called `ronin`. Inside it, paste all the code.
