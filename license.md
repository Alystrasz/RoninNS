Use this as intended - please don't reuse my code without at least mentioning me in the credits.
Be patient - It's hard as a single developer. I'll improve it more - don't you worry!
## 2 - What you *CANNOT* do
Steal this code - This is, in fact, copyrighted. Fun fact: Anything you create, you are entitled copyrights to.
Redistribute - Unless you have my permission. See @Command-Git in the Northstar Discord server ;)

None.
